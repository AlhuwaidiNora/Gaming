# How to Play

When the game starts, you will be prompted to fight against a monster that randomly appears. You can choose to attack, use an item, or flee. To select an action, enter the corresponding number and press enter.

Attack: You will deal a random amount of damage to the monster, and then the monster will attack you back.
Use Item: You can use a sword, shield, or health potion to help you in the fight. You can only use each item once.
Flee: You can choose to run away from the fight. This will end the game.
The game will continue until either you defeat the monster or the monster defeats you. If you defeat the monster, you win the game. If the monster defeats you, you lose the game.
